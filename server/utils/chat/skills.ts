- If the user refers to a workout by title, date, sport, or rough timeframe rather than by ID, first use planning read/search tools to identify the exact target record. Do not ask for an ID that you can discover yourself.
- For delete or update requests, perform discovery with planning tools first, then call the mutation tool once the target is clear.
- If multiple plausible target workouts are found, ask a concise clarification question that names the candidates.
- For schedule changes, prefer updating or rescheduling over delete-and-recreate unless the user explicitly wants replacement.
- When the user has already provided enough details for a plan change, call the planning mutation tool immediately.
- If approval is required, the approval UI must come from the planning tool call itself.
- If approval would be needed, emit the planning mutation tool call first so the system can create the approval request. Without the tool call, there is nothing for the user to approve.
- Never ask for approval in plain text without first invoking the relevant planning mutation tool.
- If the user approves a prepared planning action, immediately execute that exact approved planning tool call.
- After approval, do not just acknowledge the action in text. Execute the tool first, then report the result.
- Do not call patch_planned_workout_structure or set_planned_workout_structure on the same workout in the same turn as generate_planned_workout_structure or adjust_planned_workout — async jobs overwrite direct edits.

- Use "availability" for schedule slots, training availability, gym access, or day constraints.
- Use "recommendations" for workout recommendations or recommendation details.
- Use "wellness" for recovery metrics, symptom logging, sleep, soreness, fatigue, or wellness history.
- Use "analysis" for training-load analysis, forecasting, explicit math, pace/zones calculations, or charts.
- Use "nutrition" for meal, hydration, fueling, or nutrition-log requests.
- Use "memory" when the user explicitly asks to remember, forget, review, or update saved memory.
- Use "general_chat" when no tools are needed right now.
- If a write workflow is already in progress and the user reports a problem with approval UI, missing buttons, or asks what happened, keep the original write skill in the bundle. You may add "support", but do not replace the write skill with support-only routing.
- Preserve helper tool access when needed. Example: nutrition logging "right now" still needs time-related helper tools; relative-day writes still need temporal resolution tools.
- Never route a turn to tool-free behavior if the assistant still needs tools to safely complete or explain an in-progress mutation.
- If unsure, return skillIds ["general_chat"] and useTools false.
- This router must work across languages. Infer intent semantically, not by English-only wording.
- No more than 3 skills.
- useTools should be true only when the current turn needs tool access now.
- Set extractMemories true when the latest user turn likely contains durable memory worth capturing after the reply, even if no memory tool is needed in this turn.
- Keep extractMemories false for explicit remember/forget commands, since those should use memory tools directly.

Context:
- Tool approval enabled: ${params.requireToolApproval ? 'yes' : 'no'}
- Nutrition tracking enabled: ${params.nutritionTrackingEnabled === false ? 'no' : 'yes'}
${historySummary ? `- Room history summary: ${historySummary}` : ''}

Recent conversation:
${recentConversation || '(none)'}

Latest user message:
${latestUserText || '(empty)'}

Guardrails:
- Do not route to "support" just because the user says things like "why no text back", "why no reply", or similar conversational complaints when the recent conversation already shows the assistant replying normally.
- For those cases, prefer "general_chat" unless the user explicitly asks to report a bug, open a ticket, contact support, or fix a real product failure.`

      : `## Execution Integrity Rules

- Never claim that a write action was completed, is currently being applied, or was handled manually unless a matching tool call actually succeeded in this turn.
- If a write action still needs approval, say it is pending approval. Do not imply it already happened.
- If approval is required for a write action, approval must come from a real tool call in this turn. Never ask the user to approve, confirm, or click **Approve** unless that tool call has already been emitted.
- If the user reports that approval UI is missing or broken, explain that the action is blocked until approval can be completed or the action is re-issued through the proper tool flow.
- When helper tools are available for the selected domains, use them instead of improvising missing facts like the current time, resolved date, or record IDs.
- When tools are enabled and the user refers to an existing record by title, date, rough timeframe, or descriptive text, use discovery/read tools first to identify the exact target before mutating.
- Do not finish a tool-enabled turn with zero tool calls unless you are asking a specific blocking clarification question that names the missing detail.
- If tools are enabled for this turn and the user has already provided enough information, prefer calling the relevant tool over answering with unsupported free text.`
