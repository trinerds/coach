## Methodology

1. Area-by-area pass — pages, components, API routes, triggers, stores per domain
2. Pattern scan — `onTaskFailed` gaps, silent catch, unscoped localStorage, missing auth, webhooks
3. Verify in code — every issue cites real file paths and behavior
4. Flat files — `docs/issues/NNN-slug.md` + index in [app-review-issues.md](./app-review-issues.md)
5. Dedup against existing issue files before filing new issues

## Phase plan

### Phase 1 — Foundation ✅

- [x] Read issue process, initial review 039–061
- [x] Create `app-review-issues.md`, `REVIEW-PROGRESS.md`

### Phase 2 — Core user flows ✅

- [x] Workouts, nutrition, coaching, chat, plans, library
- [x] Performance, analytics, feed, activities, fitness, events

### Phase 3 — Coaching, admin, public ✅

- [x] Share tokens, join/onboarding, developer portal, admin panel

### Phase 4 — Backend sweep ✅

- [x] Webhook auth audit (most providers) — **fixes postponed** pending third-party coordination
- [x] API auth samples (admin, oauth, share, join) — **auth hardening postponed**
- [x] Trigger tasks deep pass (ingest, analyze, generate, messaging)
- [x] Automated API auth grep (with delegated-auth awareness)

### Phase 5 — Polish ✅ (core complete)

- [x] i18n audit — major gaps documented (199–207)
- [x] Accessibility spot checks (208–215)
- [x] Sentry cross-ref (187, 196, 197)
- [x] Profile settings deep dive (186–198)
- [ ] Remaining: exhaustive per-page i18n grep (low priority)
- [ ] Remaining: automated Sentry → issue mapping script
